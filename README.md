Title : Diffusion Models for Gravitational Lensing Simulation

Description : Strong gravitational lensing is a promising probe of the substructure of dark matter to better understand its underlying nature. Deep learning methods have the potential to accurately identify images containing substructure and differentiate WIMP particle dark matter from other well-motivated models, including axions and axion-like particles, warm dark matter, etc.

Traditional simulations of gravitational lensing are time-consuming and require extensive computational resources. This project proposes the use of diffusion models, a class of generative models known for their ability to produce high-quality, detailed images from a distribution of noise, to simulate strong gravitational lensing images. We aim to generate realistic simulations of gravitational lensing events that can be used to augment datasets for machine learning models and facilitate the development of better domain adaptation and self-supervised models aimed at bridging the gap between simulated and real images of gravitational lensing. Furthermore, we will also investigate leveraging conditional diffusion models to generate gravitational lensing simulations by conditioning the model on specific parameters related to the lensing events, such as the mass distribution of the lensing galaxy, orientation, and the redshift of both the source and the lens.

To begin this project, I initially trained a diffusion model using different labels. Then, I experimented by conditioning the model on a single astrophysical variable. Building on these initial efforts, I eventually expanded the approach to include multiple astrophysical variables.

# Class Conditional Diffusion model

In this project, I trained a diffusion model with labels “axion,” “CDM,” and “no_sub” as conditions. Additionally, I trained a ResNet model to classify these same categories. To evaluate the quality of the images generated by the diffusion model, I used the ResNet model. By generating images using the diffusion model and then plotting a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve based on the ResNet model’s classifications, I could assess how well the ResNet model could distinguish between the different classes using the generated images.

# Variable Conditional Diffusion model

I have trained a diffusion model conditioned on all astrophysical variables, alongside training a ResNet-18 model using these variables for regression. Following the training, I generated images using the diffusion model and created scatter plots to visualize the relationships between the generated images and the corresponding astrophysical variables. This process allowed me to effectively analyze the performance and correlations of the models based on the generated data. Below I have showed this plot for one astrophysical variable
